# repo-practice
Hi my name is Ali and this is my portfolio to start.
I'm looking forward into improving the code and
adding animations from this point, still have
to get into javascript in order to add animations.
I heard that you can make animations using CSS but
it seems to be a rigid and barebones way to do it.
