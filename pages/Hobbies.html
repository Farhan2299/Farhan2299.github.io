		<h4>Intro</h4>
		<p>
			Hi everyone!<br>
			My name is Ali and I'm excited to be in this class to learn more 
			about software engineering.<br>I remember taking a web developement class in high school, worked a few jobs in between.<br>I'm glad to be back to revisit a passion that I haven't touched on in years because of life circumstances.

		<h4>Hobbies</h4>
		<p>
			My interests are playing soccer, music, and making art on photoshop.<br>
			Activities such as pick up soccer with a couple friends on a sunny day.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I'm studying or just trying to vibe with my friends
			I like to open up some classical music,<br> one of my friends' way of asking what the song name is is "what is that melody?"<br> I first got my classical music interest from this recommended video on youtube called "Classical Music is NOT Boring."<br> That specific video was uploaded June of this year,<br> I've enjoyed going back to it every since I first clicked on it and listened to the 2 and a half hour length.
